Built release mode font 'C:\apps\Integrated_Code_Fire\workbench\SourceHanMono\Hong_Kong.ExtraLight.SourceHanMono.otf' Revision 1.002

# For the two lines above: The name changes.
# It might be smart:
# 1) to confirm that the raw number of "Built release" lines == "makeotfexe processing" lines.
# 2) to confirm that the number of "Built release" lines == the number of expected fonts.

# If an output message doesn't match one of the above, I want to see it.
